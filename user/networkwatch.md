I've researched the Terraform resources for Azure Network Watcher. I found documentation for azurerm_network_watcher, azurerm_network_watcher_flow_log, azurerm_virtual_machine_packet_capture, and
  azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set_packet_capture. However, I found no specific resources for "topology," "IP flow verify," "NSG diagnostics," "next hop," "effective security rules," or "connection troubleshoot," suggesting
  they may be part of the main azurerm_network_watcher resource or not yet supported by Terraform's Azure provider. I will now summarize my findings and provide documentation links.
  Based on my research, here is a summary of the available Terraform resources for Azure Network Watcher and its related tools:

  Core Network Watcher Resource

   * `azurerm_network_watcher`: This is the foundational resource required to create and manage a Network Watcher instance within a specific Azure region. It is the prerequisite for utilizing any other Network Watcher
     features.
       * Terraform Documentation: `azurerm_network_watcher` (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_watcher)

  Flow Logs

   * `azurerm_network_watcher_flow_log`: This resource enables you to configure and manage Network Security Group (NSG) Flow Logs. It allows you to log IP traffic that flows through an NSG, define retention policies, and
     integrate with Traffic Analytics for more advanced analysis and visualization.
       * Terraform Documentation: `azurerm_network_watcher_flow_log` (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_watcher_flow_log)

  Packet Capture

   * `azurerm_virtual_machine_packet_capture`: Use this resource to create and manage packet captures on a specific Azure Virtual Machine. You can apply filters to capture only the traffic you need and save the capture file
     to an Azure Storage account.
       * Terraform Documentation: `azurerm_virtual_machine_packet_capture` (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine_packet_capture)
   * `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set_packet_capture`: Similar to the VM packet capture resource, this allows you to perform packet captures on instances within a Virtual Machine Scale Set.
       * Terraform Documentation: `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set_packet_capture` (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine_scale_set_packet_capture)

  Other Network Watcher Tools

  My search did not find specific Terraform resources for the following Network Watcher tools:

   * Topology
   * IP flow verify
   * NSG diagnostics
   * Next hop
   * Effective security rules
   * Connection troubleshoot
   * VPN troubleshoot
